      <p class="dev-extra">
        The Light Between has become my personal passion project after creating its protoype as my final for my Intro to Unreal course at Louisiana State University. 
        The game is a nod to my admiration for games with unique styles and mechanics such as Ori and the Will of the Wisps, Little Nightmares, and even Super Mario Bros. 
        Not only that, but I've also had such a fasination with lighting and how it impacts a game, so I thought "why not make a game that actually uses that light for its mechanics?". 
        I've been using this game as a way for me to learn and experiment with all that goes into game creation (coding and blueprinting, concept design, animation, modeling, level design, and so much more).

          Behind every game that looks great is the process of creating logic that gets the game actually functioning. 
          That was the first challenge I tackled in Unreal 5.6 with blueprinting and coding everything from the movement to gaining new abilities to being able to switch into your shadow form.
          Above is the prototype testing all of that logic in a very blocky version of the level design.

          Now with the level design finishing up, I'm working on modeling my own assets for the game.
          Above is the most recent of those models (a hollow log that the player will be able to walk through when in their shadow form). 
          All base modeling has been done in Autodesk Maya.
